# SQL_Doctor_Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis of Hospital Admissions using SQL
As part of my journey into data science, this project focuses on foundational data extraction, manipulation, and analysis skills using SQL. It involves creating, populating, and querying a relational database designed to mimic real-world hospital patient and admission records.

The primary objective is to answer common analytical questions by writing clean, efficient SQL queries, thereby demonstrating proficiency in relational logic and data aggregation.

Key Skills Demonstrated
Relational Database Design: A normalized schema with five interconnected tables (patients, doctors, admissions, province_names).

Data Definition (DDL) & Manipulation (DML): Writing scripts to create the database schema and populate it with realistic mock data.

Complex Querying: Utilizing various JOIN types to retrieve data from multiple tables.

Data Aggregation: Using GROUP BY with aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG) to generate summary reports.

Advanced Filtering: Applying conditional logic with WHERE and HAVING to answer specific questions.

Data Transformation: Using functions like CONCAT, ROUND, and CASE to format and clean data for display.

Subqueries & Anti-Joins: Implementing NOT IN and LEFT JOIN...IS NULL to find records that do not have corresponding entries in other tables.

Technologies Used
Language: SQL

Database: MySQL (run via MySQL Workbench)
